# Storm-Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to answer two key questions:
Which weather events were most harmful to the population health, and which weather events had the greatest economic consequences. 
Harm to population health is measured in terms of injuries and fatalities, while economic consequences are measured in terms of dollar amounts.
